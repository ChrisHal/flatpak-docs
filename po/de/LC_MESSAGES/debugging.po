"Because Flatpak runs each application inside a sandbox, debugging tools "
"can't be used in the usual way, and must instead be run from inside the "
"sandbox. To get a shell inside an application's sandbox, it can be run "
"with the ``--command`` option::"

#: ../../debugging.rst:16
msgid ""
"This creates a sandbox for the application with the given ID and, instead"
" of running the application, runs a shell inside the sandbox. From the "
"shell prompt, it is then possible to run the application. This can also "
"be done using any debugging tools that you want to use. For example, to "
"run the application with ``gdb``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../debugging.rst:24
msgid ""
"This works because the ``--devel`` option tells Flatpak to use the SDK as"
" the runtime, which includes debugging tools like ``gdb``. The "
"``--devel`` option also adjusts the sandbox setup to enable debugging."

"The Freedesktop SDK (on which many others are based), includes a range of"
" debugging tools, such as ``gdb``, ``strace``, ``nm``, ``dbus-send``, "
"``dconf``, and many others."
msgstr ""

#: ../../debugging.rst:34
msgid ""
"``gdb`` is much more useful when it has access to debug information for "
"the application and the runtime it is using. Flatpak splits this "
"information off into debug extensions, which you should install before "
"debugging an application::"

#: ../../debugging.rst:41

"When the ``--devel`` option is used, Flatpak will automatically use any "
"matching debug extensions that it finds."

"It is also possible to get a shell inside an application sandbox without "
"having to install it. This is done using ``flatpak-builder``'s ``--run`` "

"Like many other packaging systems, Flatpak separates bulky debug "
"information from regular content and ships it separately, in what is "
"called a ``.Debug`` extension."

"When an application is built, ``flatpak-builder`` automatically creates a"

"It is sometimes useful to have extra permissions in a sandbox when "

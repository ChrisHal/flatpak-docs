"Flatpak repositories use archive-z2, meaning that they contain a single "
"file for each file in the application. This means that pull operations "
"involve a lot of HTTP requests. Since new requests can be slow, it is "
"important to enable HTTP keep-alive on the web server that is hosting "
"your repository."

"Flatpak supports something called static deltas. These are single files "
"that contain all the data needed to go between two revisions (or from "
"nothing to a revision). Creating such deltas will take up more space on "
"the server, but will make downloads much faster. This can be done with "
"the ``flatpak build-update-repo --generate-static-deltas`` option."

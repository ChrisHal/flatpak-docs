"To use a repository to publish an application, it is possible to either host"

"Software center applications like GNOME Software or KDE Discover allow "
"browsing repositories, and can also dynamically promote new or popular "
"applications. If you use Flathub, the repository will typically have already"
" been added by users, so adding an application to the repository is "
"sufficient to make it available to them."

"``.flatpakref`` files can be used in combination with repositories to "

"Internally, ``.flatpakref`` files are simple description files that include "

"As can be seen, the file includes the ID of the application and the location"

"therefore contain all the information needed to install an application."

"One advantage of ``.flatpakref`` files is that they can be used to install "

msgid ""
"``.flatpakref`` can be used to install applications from the command line as"

msgid ""
"Flatpak repositories are similar to Git repositories, in that they store "
"every version of an application by keeping a record of the difference "
"between each version. This makes updating efficient, since only the "
"difference (or \"delta\") between two versions needs to be downloaded when "
"an update is performed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../repositories.rst:52
msgid ""
"When a new version of an application is added to a repository, it "
"immediately becomes available to users. Software centers are able to "
"automatically check for and install new versions. Those who are using the "
"command line have to manually run ``flatpak update`` to check for and "
"install new versions of any applications they have installed."

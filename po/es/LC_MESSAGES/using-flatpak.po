"This page provides an introduction to the ``flatpak`` command line "
"interface, and explains essential technical conventions as well as the "
"most common commands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:8
msgid ""
"End users shouldn't generally need to use this page or the Flatpak "
"command line interface, since Flatpak can be easily used through "
"graphical software management tools, though they are of course free to "
"use the command line if they prefer!"

msgid "The flatpak command"
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:17
msgid ""
"``flatpak`` is the primary Flatpak command, to which specific commands "
"are appended. For example, the command to install something is ``flatpak "
"install`` and the command to uninstall is ``flatpak uninstall``."

msgid "Identifiers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:24
msgid ""
"Flatpak identifies each application and runtime using a unique three-part"
" identifier, such as ``com.company.App``. The final segment of this "
"address is the object's name, and the preceding part identifies the "
"developer, so that the same developer can have multiple applications, "
"like ``com.company.App1`` and ``com.company.App2``."

msgid "Identifier triples"
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:33
msgid ""
"Typically it is sufficient to refer to objects using their ID. However, "
"in some situations it is necessary to refer to a specific version of an "
"object, or to a specific architecture. For example, some applications "
"might be available as a stable and a testing version, in which case it is"
" necessary to specify which one you want to install."
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:39
msgid ""
"Flatpak allows architectures and versions to be specified using an "
"object's identifier triple. This takes the form of "
"``name/architecture/branch``, such as ``com.company.App/i386/stable``. "
"(Branch is the term used to refer to versions of the same object.) The "
"first part of the triple is the ID, the second part is the architecture, "
"and the third part is the branch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:45
msgid ""
"Identifier triples can also be used to specify just the architecture or "
"the branch, by leaving part of the triple blank. For example, "
"``com.company.App//stable`` would just specify the branch, and "
"``com.company.App/i386//`` just specifies the architecture."

msgid "System versus user"
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:56
msgid ""
"Flatpak commands can be run either system-wide or per-user. Applications "
"and runtimes that are installed system-wide are available to all users on"
" the system. Applications and runtimes that are installed per-user are "
"only available to the users that installed them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:61
msgid ""
"The same principle applies to repositories - repositories that have been "
"added system-wide are available to all users, whereas per-user "
"repositories can only be used by a particular user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:65
msgid ""
"Flatpak commands are run system-wide by default. If you are installing "
"applications for day-to-day usage, it is recommended to stick with this "
"default behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../using-flatpak.rst:69
msgid ""
"However, running commands per-user can be useful for testing and "
"development purposes, since objects that are installed in this way won't "
"be available to other users on the system. To do this, use the ``--user``"
" option, which can be used in combination with most ``flatpak`` commands."

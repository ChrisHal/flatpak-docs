"Each Flatpak app is required to have a runtime. This provides the "
"environment that the app runs in, and includes a set of libraries that it "
"can access. The app's runtime must be present on a system for it to run."

msgid ""
"Each runtime is paired with an SDK (Software Develpment Kit). For example, "
"for the Freedesktop 1.6 runtime, there is also a Freedesktop 1.6 SDK. The "
"SDK includes the same things as the regular runtime, but also includes all "
"the additional development resources and tools that are required to build an"
" app, such as build and packaging tools, header files, compilers and "
"debuggers."

"Applications must be built with the SDK that corresponds to their runtime. "
"For example, an application that uses the Freedesktop 1.6 runtime in order "
"to run must be built with the Freedesktop 1.6 SDK."

msgid ""
"When you come to build a Flatpak app, you will need to decide which runtime "
"it will use. An overview of the runtimes that are available can be found in "
"the :doc:`available-runtimes` page. There are deliberately only a small "
"number of runtimes to choose from."

"Runtimes require regular maintenance, and application developers should "
"generally not consider creating their own."

"Once you have chosen a runtime for your application, it is necessary to "
"install it as well as the matching SDK. (Runtimes and SDKs are installed in "

"A number of the examples in these docs use this runtime and SDK, so it is a "
"good idea to try this command yourself."
